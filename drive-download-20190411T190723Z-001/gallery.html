	<h1>Climate Change Pictures</h1>
<p>These three pictures show how climate change is effecting the world, and they are alot of ways we can make the enviorment better and to prevent climate change, The first picture shows a glacier that is being melted due to the climate change around the earth. and it can effect the animals that live around the glacier and for some animals like seals, penguins,and polar bears. The second picture shows a sidewalk about to be flooded and its about to cover up the whole side walk with water that cam from the sea. The third picture shows a bench about to be overflooded and its tangled with tree brances and plastic bags. These three pictures shows that we need to do something about climate change and to better the earth and the enovirment so we wont have to face these problems in the earth.</p>
