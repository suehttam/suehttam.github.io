    <p> People come in all different shapes and sizes but we have to appreciate and acccept people for who they are.
          In the video it shows different types of shapes in different forms. The circle feels left out because he is not the same like the other shapes, The other shapes told the circle that you can't be like everyone else and you can;t fit in all the time. Sometimes its good to be you becasue if you be like everyone else you wont find your own character. but if you find yourself and your character people will love you for you. The circle thought about it and he apprecaited the other diiferent looking shapes for the advice. 
          This is awareness for anyone that is trying to find yourself.. Dont try to fit in with the crowd be yourslef amd watch how you stand out. </p>
